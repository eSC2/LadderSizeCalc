    A stair, or stairway is one or more steps leading from floor to floor. It is considered the safer access solution comparing to rung and step ladder. A stair may include landing and/or handrail
    depending on the requirement, and it is to be inclined between 20째 and 45째. The Australia Standard AS1657 sets out requirements for the design, selection, construction and installation of stair
    and is to be strictly followed for compliances. Please contact certified supplier/installer or refer to Australian Standard AS1657 for more information.

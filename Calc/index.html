            A twin-stile rung ladder comprises of two stiles and rungs that assists user ascending/descending between levels. It is to be inclined between 70° and 90°, and can be both portable or
            permanently fixed to a structure. The Australia Standard AS1657 sets out requirements for the design, selection, construction and installation of ladder and is to be strictly followed for
            compliances. Please contact certified supplier/installer or refer to Australian Standard AS1657 for more information.

            A step ladder is similar to rung ladder where it comprises of two stiles and flat steps that assists user ascending/descending between levels, contra to round rungs. It is to be inclined
            between 60° and 70°, and can only be permanently fixed to a structure. The Australia Standard AS1657 sets out requirements for the design, selection, construction and installation of
            ladder and is to be strictly followed for compliances. Please contact certified supplier/installer or refer to Australian Standard AS1657 for more information.

            A stair, stairway or staircase is a permanent structure designed to connect large vertical distance between level, by dividing it into steps with equal limited vertical distances. A stair
            is considered safer and provides safer access comparing to rung and step ladder, but it also requires larger area due to its structure. It has a slope between 20° to 45° with a preferred
            range within 30° to 38°<strong>*</strong>, as well as additional requirements listed below. The Australia Standard AS1657 sets out requirements for the design, selection, construction and
            installation of stair and is to be strictly followed for compliances. Please contact certified supplier/installer or refer to Australian Standard AS1657 for more information.
